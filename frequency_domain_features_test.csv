About Dataset

The data comprises various attributes taken from signals measured using ECG recorded for different individuals having different heart rates at the time the measurement was taken. These various features contribute to the heart rate at the given instant of time for the individual.

You have been provided with a total of 7 CSV files with the names as follows:
timedomainfeaturestrain.csv - This file contains all time domain features of heart rate for training data frequencydomainfeaturestrain.csv - This file contains all frequency domain features of heart rate for training data
heartratenonlinearfeaturestrain.csv - This file contains all non linear features of heart rate for training data timedomainfeaturestest.csv - This file contains all time domain features of heart rate for testing data
frequencydomainfeaturestest.csv - This file contains all frequency domain features of heart rate for testing data heartratenonlinearfeaturestest.csv - This file contains all non linear features of heart rate for testing data
sample_submission.csv - This file contains the format in which you need to make submissions to the portal

Following is the data dictionary for the features you will come across in the files mentioned:
